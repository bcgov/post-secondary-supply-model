## Overview

_Provide a brief summary of the module’s purpose, scope, and key objectives._

## Data Sources and Storage

### External Data Sources

#### [External Data Source Name]

Source: [Data provider or organization]  
Access Method: [Describe how data is accessed, e.g., API, direct download, R package]

  - [List any required credentials, API keys, or setup steps]
  - Function calls: [Relevant function or method]

Description: [Brief description of the data, coverage, and structure]

<!-- Repeat the above callout for each external data source -->

### Internal/Processed Data Sources

#### [Internal Data Product Name]

Source: [Describe how/where the data is generated or stored]  
Access Method: [Describe how to access the data]

  - File location: [Path or variable]
  - Processing methodology: [Link to documentation or code if available]

Description: [Brief description of the processed data]


### Data Storage Structure

All data is stored in a hierarchical folder structure, accessible via [describe access method/tool].

```
[BASE_FOLDER]/
├── data/
    ├── source/          # Processed intermediate files
    └── raw/             # Raw input data
        └── [subfolder]/ # [Description]
└── outputs/
    ├── tables/          # Final output tables  
    └── visuals/         # Maps and visualizations
```

## Technical Specifications

### Dependencies and Environment Requirements

#### System Requirements

- Network Access: [List required network resources]
- Storage: [Note storage requirements]
- Memory: [Note memory requirements]
- External Data: [List any required external data]

#### R Package Dependencies

The following R packages are required for this module:

- [List core data processing packages]
- [List spatial analysis packages]
- [List visualization/statistics packages]
- [List file management packages]



#### Authentication Setup

```r
# Example: API key configuration
[package]::set_api_key('YOUR_API_KEY', install = TRUE)
```

### Global Constants and Configuration

Global constants and configuration settings are centralized in a configuration file (e.g., `settings.R`). This file defines key parameters, file paths, and data validation requirements. Below is a summary of the most critical settings. For a complete list, refer to the configuration file in the project repository.

#### Data Processing and Filtering

  - `REFERENCE_YEAR`: [Year] - Reference year for primary data.
  - `CURRENT_YEAR`: [Year] - Current year for projections/analysis.
  - `FACILITY_TAG`: [Tag] - Identifier for facilities/entities.
  - `REQUIRED_COLS`: [List of required columns for validation]
  - `POP_COLS`: [List of population-related columns]


#### File Path Configuration

  - `BASE_FOLDER`: Base folder for storage.
  - `SRC_DATA_FOLDER`: Directory for source data files.
  - `RAW_DATA_FOLDER`: Directory for raw input data.
  - `OUTPUTS_FOLDER`: Directory for outputs.

[Add other relevant settings as needed]


## Methodology Overview

_Repeat for each major step/script in the module_

### [Method 1 Title]

#### Methods

#### Data Dictionary

##### [Table 1 Name]
